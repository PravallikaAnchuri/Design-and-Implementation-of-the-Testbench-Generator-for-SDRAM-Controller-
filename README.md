# Design and Implementation of the Testbench Generator for SDRAM Controller-

The goal of this project would be to create a Python program that generates a SystemVerilog testbench for verifying an SDRAM controller. The testbench would include a set of test cases that exercise various features of the controller, such as writing and reading different data patterns, testing error handling logic, and so on.

This code defines a function generate_testbench that takes two arguments: num_tests, the number of test cases to generate, and data_width, the width of the data bus in bits. The function generates a SystemVerilog testbench as a string, which includes a module declaration, an instance of the SDRAMController module, and a test case function that writes and reads a series of addresses and data values.

The test case function writes a hexadecimal data value to a hexadecimal address, and then reads the value back and checks that it is the same as the value written. The addresses and data values are generated using string formatting and the range function.

The function also includes an initial block that generates a clock signal for the testbench.

To generate a testbench with 10 test cases and a data width of 32 bits, you can call the generate_testbench function

You can then print the generated testbench to the console or save it to a file using the print function or the write method of a file object.

This is just one possible design for a testbench generator, and you can customize it to suit your specific needs. For example, you might want to include additional features such as error injection, randomization, or coverage collection.
